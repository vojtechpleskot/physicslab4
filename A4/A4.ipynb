    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of attenuation of a gamma-ray beam in a medium cannot be considered continuous as is the case for heavy charged particles. In the interaction of a photon with electrons of an atomic shell of a medium, the photon either loses all its energy by the photoelectric effect or by the creation of electron-positron pairs, or part of it by Compton (incoherent) scattering. The creation of electron-positron pairs can naturally also occur in the field of the nucleus. In coherent scattering, the photon does not deposit energy but changes direction. In incoherent scattering, it also changes direction besides the energy loss. For the experiment, the consequence of these interactions is the attenuation of the gamma-ray beam when passing through a layer of material of thickness $t$ according to the relation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N = N_0 e^{-\\mu t},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $N_0$ is the number of gamma quanta incident on a layer of material of thickness $t$, $N$ is the number of photons with the original energy behind the layer of material, $\\mu$ is the absorption coefficient or linear attenuation coefficient with the dimension $\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$.\n",
    "Since the dependence of the attenuation of the gamma-ray beam on the thickness of the material has an exponential character, there is always a non-zero probability that a gamma quantum will pass through any thickness of any material without interaction.\n",
    "Thus, for each given energy of incident photons, $E_\\gamma$, the free path of individual photons can differ significantly from the mean free path $1/\\mu(E_\\gamma)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter is very well known. The individual cross-sections as a function of photon energy are, among other things, tabulated. The dependence of the absorption coefficient $\\mu$ on the energy of incident photons $E_\\gamma$ is shown for lead in the figure below (just run the python code). For specific experiments, it is often more practical to determine the attenuation of the beam experimentally (for a specific detector, geometry, ...) and possibly verify it using a computer simulation by the Monte Carlo method.\n",
    "For the interaction of photons with material, the \"nuclear photoelectric effect\" (i.e., photo-nuclear reactions - e.g., $(\\gamma, n)$) also has a non-zero effective cross-section. However, the effective cross-section of these reactions is negligible up to the initial photon energy on the order of ten MeV compared to the effective cross-sections of the above-mentioned interactions."
