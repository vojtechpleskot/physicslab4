    "\n",
    "Computer modeling of the detector response to particle passage allows for the visualization of the passage of various particles through the calorimeter material in an interactive version and the calculation of particle energy losses in all parts of the calorimeter. A simple structure similar to the TileCal hadronic calorimeter [1], which is part of the ATLAS experiment [2] located at the LHC accelerator at CERN, is implemented in the simulation program. The simulation is programmed in Geant4 [3] and the ROOT [4] program is used to process the results. The calorimeter model, with a total length of $160~\\mathrm{cm}$, consists of 80 layers of scintillator and iron, and its transverse dimensions are $80\\times 80~\\mathrm{cm}^2$."

    "# Calorimeters\n",
    "\n",
    "Calorimeters measure the energy and direction of charged and neutral particles. Energy measurement is based on complete particle absorption. A high-energy particle entering the calorimeter interacts with its material, losing energy and creating secondary particles. These can create further particles in a cascade called a shower. The shower stops when the energy of each particle drops below a threshold. The original particle's direction is determined from the shower's transverse profile. There are homogeneous and sampling calorimeters. Sampling calorimeters use alternating layers of dense absorbers (like iron or lead) and active media (like ionization chambers or scintillators). Secondary particles are created in the absorber and deposit detectable energy in the active medium. The total signal is proportional to the original particle's energy."

    "Particles interact with calorimeter material in several ways. They are ordered according to how efficiently they deposit energy in the calorimeter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electromagnetic (EM) showers: Electrons ($e^-$), positrons ($e^+$), photons ($\\gamma$), and neutral pions ($\\pi^0$) create EM showers. High-energy photons convert to $e^-e^+$ pairs, which produce bremsstrahlung photons, repeating the process. $\\pi^0$ decays rapidly into two photons, also creating an EM shower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hadronic showers: All high-energy hadrons (except $\\pi^0$) produce hadronic showers, which have two components:\n",
    "  - An EM component from $\\pi^0$ production.\n",
    "  - A purely hadronic component, including secondary hadrons and \"invisible\" energy (energy used to break nuclei or carried away by non-interacting particles like neutrinos).\n",
    "Because of the \"invisible\" energy, an electron generally produces a larger signal than a hadron with the same initial energy. Also, interaction lengths for electrons/photons are much smaller than for hadrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ionizing particles: Low-energy charged particles and muons lose energy primarily through ionization. Muons with energies of several hundred GeV deposit only a small fraction of their energy in calorimeters (about 1 GeV per meter in iron).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-interacting particles: Neutrinos interact only weakly and have such long mean free paths that they almost never interact in a calorimeter.\n"

    "In our specific case, the calorimeter model consists of layers of iron and scintillator in a similar ratio to that found in the ATLAS experiment's hadronic calorimeter at CERN. Approximately 3-4% of the energy is lost as particles pass through the scintillator, and this portion represents the measurable energy from a physics standpoint. Part of the energy deposited in the scintillator is emitted as light, which can be guided via optical fibers to a photomultiplier. Here, the light signal is converted into an electrical charge, which is then further processed."
