    "Computer modeling of the detector response to particle passage allows for the visualization of the passage of various particles through the calorimeter material in an interactive version and the calculation of particle energy losses in all parts of the calorimeter. A simple structure similar to the TileCal hadronic calorimeter [1], which is part of the ATLAS experiment [2] located at the LHC accelerator at CERN, is implemented in the simulation program. The simulation is programmed in Geant4 [3] and the ROOT [4] program is used to process the results. The calorimeter model, with a total length of $160~\\mathrm{cm}$, consists of 80 layers of scintillator and iron, and its transverse dimensions are $80\\times 80~\\mathrm{cm}^2$."

    "Calorimeters measure the energy and direction of charged and neutral particles. Energy measurement is based on complete particle absorption. A high-energy particle entering the calorimeter interacts with its material, losing energy and creating secondary particles. These can create further particles in a cascade called a shower. The shower stops when the energy of each particle drops below a threshold. The original particle's direction is determined from the shower's transverse profile. There are homogeneous and sampling calorimeters. Sampling calorimeters use alternating layers of dense absorbers (like iron or lead) and active media (like ionization chambers or scintillators). Secondary particles are created in the absorber and deposit detectable energy in the active medium. The total signal is proportional to the original particle's energy."

High-energy photons convert to $e^-e^+$ pairs, which produce bremsstrahlung photons, repeating the process. $\\pi^0$ decays rapidly into two photons, also creating an EM shower.\n",

Approximately 3-4% of the energy is lost as particles pass through the scintillator, and this portion represents the measurable energy from a physics standpoint. Part of the energy deposited in the scintillator is emitted as light, which can be guided via optical fibers to a photomultiplier.
