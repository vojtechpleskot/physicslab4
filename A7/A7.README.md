# About this notebook

This notebook will guide you through the analysis of data of your measurements on a simple PET laboratory setup. The notebook conains Python code that can analyze your data if you provide them in an appropriate format. 

Also, some steps of the analysis need your intervention, for example, you will have to provide your own initial parameters if a Gaussian fit goes wrong. 

You can also modify the tables and plots to your liking, omit some of them or introduce your own. The existing code provides a handy example of how to do some things in the notebook. 

The plots and tables provided by the notebook will help you, but you will have to draw final conclusions about the results. 

Outputs of the analysis are tables and plots that can be copied and pasted into your lab report, or you can submit the notebook with your data and conclusions in place of a lab report. 

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

- If you are in the JupyterHub environment on the Chimera or HPC cluster, just make sure you have the kernel `praktikum` selected.
- If you are anywhere else and don't have all the necessary libraries installed, add and run the following code cell to the beginning of the notebook:

```python
!pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jinja2 pandas seaborn uncertainties
```

In a Windows environment, replace "!" with "%".

# Adding image files

- When using JupyterHub, you can drag and drop the image directly from your computer into the markdown (text) cell of your notebook. The image will be embedded directly into the notebook.
- Alternatively, upload the files to the `A7` folder where the notebook file `A7.ipynb` is located. Then, use the following syntax to include the image in a markdown cell:
```markdown
![Short description](filename.png)
```

# How to run the code

You can run the code cell after cell by pressing `Shift+Enter` in each cell (this may vary according to the environment where you run the notebook: use the command appropriate for your environment). You can even repeatedly run a some cells, but this may not work at all times. If you run into problems, look for `Restart Kernel` or `Restart Kernel and Clear All output` or `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells` in the menu of your notebook environment, and use the appropriate command. 

You can also run all the notebook code at once. It will then use the sample data and run the whole analysis with default settings. You may use the sample data to learn how to use the notebook. 

# User input

There are several things the user has to do to use the notebook:
- import data
- check quality of fits and modify initial fit parameters if necessary
- draw conclusions about the quality and consistency of the results
