# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

- If you are in the JupyterHub environment on the Chimera or HPC cluster, just make sure you have the kernel `praktikum` selected.
- If you are anywhere else and don't have all the necessary libraries installed, add and run the following code cell to the beginning of the notebook:

```python
!pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas uncertainties IPython
```

In a Windows environment, replace "!" with "%".

# Adding image files

- When using JupyterHub, you can drag and drop the image directly from your computer into the markdown (text) cell of your notebook. The image will be embedded directly into the notebook.
- Alternatively, upload the files to the `A8` folder where the notebook file `A8.ipynb` is located. Then, use the following syntax to include the image in a markdown cell:
```markdown
![Short description](filename.png)
```
